# Sales-Analysis
It is a very basic dashboard which deals with the global super store data set. This dashboard allows you to select a specific day within a year using the timeline graph. When a data is selected the rest of the dashboard updates to return the values that are relevant to the selected date. The dashboard highlights the Target Day Sales, Prior Day Sales, the Difference and the Year to the date sales. If the Prior Day Sales are higher than the Targeted Day Sales the block turns Red indicating that the selected date performance was low.
